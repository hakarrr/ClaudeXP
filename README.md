Every time you end a Claude Code session, a Stop hook scores what you actually did — tool uses, files edited, bug fixes, features shipped — and a framed overlay pops up right in your terminal showing the XP you earned.

Your totals sync to a shared cloud leaderboard so you can see how you stack up against everyone else running ClaudeXP. Nobody's watching you work. Nobody asked you to. It just makes closing `/exit` feel like finishing a raid.

## Install

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvanPaules/ClaudeXP/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EvanPaules/ClaudeXP/main/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. The installer:

1. Checks you have Node 18+.
2. Runs `npm install -g github:EvanPaules/ClaudeXP`.
3. Drops the Stop hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` (safe JSON merge — nothing else gets touched).
4. Claims your username on the community leaderboard.
5. You're in.

End your next Claude Code session and the overlay pops up.

## How XP works

| Signal                           | XP                      |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Session base                     | **+25**                 |
| Tool uses                        | **+5 each** (cap 100)   |
| Unique files written / edited    | **+10 each** (cap 80)   |
| Bug fix detected in transcript   | **+50**                 |
| New feature detected             | **+75**                 |
| Deep work (≥ 20 tool uses)       | **+30**                 |
| Streak (you shipped yesterday)   | **×1.15** to the total  |

ClaudeXP parses your session transcript (JSONL from Claude Code) and counts tool calls, unique file paths touched, and scans assistant responses for `fix`, `bug`, `feature`, `implement`, `refactor` — so a quick chat nets ~25 XP, a focused hour-long feature push can clear 300+.

## The ladder

Fifteen tiers from total noob to legend. XP is cumulative.

| 3  | Snippet Slinger      | 1,500   |
| 4  | Junior Dev           | 3,000   |
| 5  | Feature Builder      | 5,500   |
| 6  | Refactor Wizard      | 9,000   |
| 7  | Pull Request Pro     | 14,000  |
| 8  | Module Master        | 21,000  |
| 9  | System Thinker       | 30,000  |

## The leaderboard

Everyone running ClaudeXP lands on the same board. Your row updates every time you end a session.

```

### How is this safe?

The community backend is a public Supabase project with row-level security. Anyone with the (public) anon key can:

- **read** any row (it's a leaderboard — that's the point)
- **insert** a new username (first come, first serve)
- **update / delete** *only their own row*

Each client generates a random 48-char **owner token** on first setup and stores it in `~/.claudexp/config.json` (chmod 600). Every update request sends an `x-claudexp-owner-token` header; RLS only lets the write through if it matches the token stored on your row. Tokens can't be scraped either — the `owner_token` column is hidden from anon reads via column-level grants.

TL;DR: if someone else claims your username first, pick another. If you lose your owner token you lose the ability to update that row — delete it from a machine that still has the token, or re-claim a fresh name.

## Running your own community

Want a private ClaudeXP for your team, company, or Discord?

1. **Fork this repo.**
2. **Create a Supabase project** (free tier handles hundreds of players).
3. **Run the schema.** Supabase → SQL Editor → paste `cloud_schema.sql` → Run.
4. **Bake in your credentials.** Clone your fork, then `claudexp set-community` — paste your project URL and anon public key. That writes `community.json`.
5. **Commit & push.** Anyone who installs from your fork auto-joins your board.

Tweak `engine.js` (scoring), `levels.js` (titles / curve), `achievements.js` (trophies) — make it yours.

## How the hook actually works

Claude Code fires a **Stop** hook at the end of each response cycle. `hook.js`:

1. Reads the JSON payload from stdin (`session_id`, `transcript_path`, …).
2. Parses the JSONL transcript, counting tool uses + unique files + scanning for fix / feature / refactor keywords.
3. Scores the session (`engine.js`) and writes a row to `~/.claudexp/data.db` (SQLite, synchronous — committed before you see the overlay).
4. Checks the 8 achievements for anything newly unlocked.
5. Prints the framed overlay to **stderr** so it appears in your terminal without interfering with Claude Code's stdout.
6. PATCHes your Supabase row with the owner token (3-second timeout; next session retries cumulative).

All in under a second. Close the terminal right after — your XP is already persisted.

## Stack

- Node ≥ 18, ESM
- [`better-sqlite3`](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) for the local DB
- [`chalk`](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) for color
- [`commander`](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for the CLI
- Supabase + PostgREST via native `fetch` (no SDK)

Three dependencies. That's it.

## Data location

| What               | Where                                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Local DB           | `~/.claudexp/data.db`                         |
| Local config       | `~/.claudexp/config.json` (chmod 600)         |
| Hook registration  | `~/.claude/settings.json` (auto-managed)      |
| Community config   | `community.json` inside the installed package |

## Uninstall

```bash
claudexp hook uninstall        # remove the Stop hook entry
claudexp cloud delete          # drop your cloud profile
npm uninstall -g claudexp      # remove the binary
rm -rf ~/.claudexp              # wipe local data
```

## Contributing

PRs welcome, especially for:

- More achievements (the more ridiculous, the better)
- Better keyword detection in the transcript parser
- Cross-platform bug reports (Windows quirks especially)
- A proper plugin form if/when Claude Code ships one

Open an issue before anything non-trivial. Keep dependencies at zero if humanly possible.
